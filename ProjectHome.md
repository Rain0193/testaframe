Testaframe can be used for driving Selenium tests and/or API/service tests.
Two of its main features are:
  * the ability to run tests on multiple OS/browsers across multiple environments (e.g. localhost, CI, QA) at once and
  * polling asserts, which are especially useful for testing ajax web sites and asynchronous services.

See [README.rst](https://code.google.com/p/testaframe/source/browse/README.rst) in the source for more information.
